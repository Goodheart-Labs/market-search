We're building a fast and simple frontend search interface that lets users semantically search across forecasting markets from multiple platforms. The frontend sends a natural language query, receives vector-matched results, and displays them with titles, links, and optionally descriptions. It should feel instant and intuitive, prioritizing speed and relevance over filtering or advanced UI complexity.
